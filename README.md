"# GroceryProject-3" 

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The summary of this progect was:
  - Encapsulate a GroceryItem class with public and private variables and methods.
  - Displaying the culmination of functions and methods learned throughout the CS210 course while using the industry best standards.
  - Read an inventory file in, insert values into a C++ set, and write a back-up the file.
  - Create a menu where the user could make choices based on the menu.
  - Display proper input validation with range loops and try-catch statements.
  - Search for the item name and how many times it appears in the file.
  - Show the full list of Items and the amount of times each item appears in the file.
  - A complete histogram of Items and the amount of times each item appears in the file, denoted with a '*' character.
  - An option for the user to exit the program.
	
What did you do particularly well?

  -Overall with this project im quite proud of how it turned out, I put a lot of time and effort into it to make all parts functional, while meeting all the requirements.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

  -Removing redundancies within the code to make it more efficient.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

  -I think the most challenging part of this project was how to use pointers, I had never used them prior to this project and while I understood how they worked, it was more difficult in practice.
  -I used a lot of online tools to see examples of how pointers worked, mostly used resources like w3schools which is usually a go to because it has an area where you can try out code, I also looked up how 
  to use them on CplusPlus.com to see how they are used. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

  -I take a lot of notes, so I have the culmination of that with each project if I had a question about anything, I just asked, which I think some people have a problem with just asking questions when 
  they get stuck on something, and all the projects that I've done I have all that experience to put forth towards future projects. 
  -I think at first C++ is a duanting language at first, but now that I have the basics down for the most part, it will benifit me when I have another project with C++ or another language. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  - This program is maintainable being encapsulated all inside a class.
  - All methods are commented describing what they do in easy to read language. using the industry best standards.
  - The methods are all potentially resuable in other programs which makes it adaptable.
